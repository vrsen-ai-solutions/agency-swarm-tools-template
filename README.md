# This playbook shows how to build custom coded tools for your agents

With custom coded tools, you can query external data sources in real time. You can connect your agent to any API, run your own logic or database queries, process any data with validation.

## Step-by-Step

1. **Clone this repo**  
   [https://github.com/vrsen-ai-solutions/agency-swarm-tools-template](https://github.com/vrsen-ai-solutions/agency-swarm-tools-template)

2. **Create a project on Firebase.**

3. **Upgrade your project to the Blaze plan** (if not already done so).

4. **Go to settings → service accounts** and generate a new service account key.

5. **Add IAM Permissions** to the service account for Secret Manager access:
   1. Go to the **IAM** page
   2. Click on the desired service account **edit** icon
   3. Click on **“Add another role”**
   4. Add **Editor** and **Firebase Admin** roles

6. **Add your service account into the `functions` directory.**

7. **Copy and paste** the path from the service account key into a secret called `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROD_CREDENTIALS`.

8. **Add your `projectid`** in the `.firebaserc` file under `"projects"`.

9. **Rename** `.env.sample` with any random password.

10. **Navigate to the `functions` directory** and set up your Python environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

11. **Create your tools** using the `tools` directory.

12. **Make sure the tool class name matches** the name of the tool file!  
   Otherwise, it will not be deployed.  
   For example, `ExampleTool.py` must contain `ExampleTool` class.

13. **Adjust and test all tools** by running tool files separately.  
   > **Note:** Cloud functions are stateless, so if you need to maintain state between executions, you will need a separate file store, storage, or a database.  
   > Don’t forget to add all new requirements in `requirements.txt`.

   Example: `MyCustomTool` file

14. **Deploy tools.**  
   Push into the `main` branch and this will deploy your tools automatically.

15. **Create a schema:**
   1. Copy the URL from the “Deploy firebase functions” step in GitHub Actions
   2. Paste this into `schema.py`
   3. Remove `/mycustomtool` from the URL

   ```bash
   python schema.py
   ```

16. **Paste schema and parse into actions** for your agent.

17. **Remove any unnecessary tools** from the schema if deploying them for multiple agents in a single agent.

18. **Add your tools and/or new tools**; repeat from step 11.
